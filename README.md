Readme

About: My project is a movie database that pulls from OMDB and IMDB APIs. The IMDB API was an absolute nightmare to sorth through its JSON, but most every actor should work. There were a problem with a few but some examples that definitely work are typing in Along Came Polly and clicking Ben Stiller or typing in Bruce Almighty and clicking Mogran Freeman. Again, most every actor works but a few had inconsisntent JSON formatting that messed some things up.

One can view the worst 100 or top 250 movies without logging in, but in order to search movies and return results and to view other movies that actors have been in, one needs to create an account and log in. After logging in they have full access to the site. When they log out they receive an email.

Steps to run:

Please use python 3.5 or higher
Please pip install the imports in Main.py
matlefkofsky364Final1 is the name of the database you must create
If necessary: create a username postgres and a password of 12345678
then type python3 Main.py runserver
#I included the virtual environment files I used because some of my python files were stored incorrectly. #One should not have to use this if their python files are set up correctly #Some of my friends gave it a try and it worked fine.
